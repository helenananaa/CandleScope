## Quick Start

Requirements:

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

Start the backend with the one-command setup:

```powershell
cd backend
.\dev-server.ps1
```

On Linux/WSL:

```bash
cd backend
sh ./dev-server.sh
```

The launcher creates a repository-local `backend/.venv`, installs backend
dependencies only when `requirements.txt` changes, downloads the pinned
Pine-compatible wheel for the current platform, verifies its SHA-256 and
runtime schemas, then starts uvicorn. Later starts only perform the fast checks.
Use `-Offline` / `--offline` after one successful setup has cached dependencies
and the Release, or explicitly use
`-SkipPineRuntime` / `--skip-pine-runtime` for a Pyne-only setup.

Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

In local development the frontend uses same-origin `/api/v1`; Vite proxies
HTTP and WebSocket traffic to `http://127.0.0.1:18080` by default. Vite serves
the app at `http://127.0.0.1:15173`.

Default URLs:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `http://127.0.0.1:15173` |
| Backend | `http://127.0.0.1:18080` |
| Swagger / OpenAPI | `http://127.0.0.1:18080/docs` |
| Health | `http://127.0.0.1:18080/health` |

## What It Does

CandleScope is a local-first market charting application with:

- Exchange-aware K-line data for Binance and OKX.
- Spot and derivative market support through `exchange` and `market_type` scoped series.
- Cache-first historical queries backed by SQLite.
- Realtime K-line WebSocket streams with single-interval and multi-interval modes.
- Demand-aware historical backfill scheduling: current chart history first,
  related intervals next, subscriptions and background audits later.
- Watchlists with `none` / price-only / full subscription tiers, realtime price
  snapshots, and full-tier background K-line warm caches.
- Built-in indicators: `MA`, `EMA`, `MACD`, `RSI`, `BOLL`, `ATR`, and `VOL`.
- Pyne, a Pine-style Python runtime for custom indicators.
- Interactive chart tools: line variants, freehand drawing, text annotations, Fibonacci retracement, and long/short position tools.
- Multi-pane chart layout for price, volume, and oscillator indicators.
- Settings tools for proxy testing, symbol metadata refresh, storage repair, gap scanning, and retention limits.

## Architecture

Current backend data flow:

```text
Exchange WS / REST
        |
        v
ingestion
        | MarketEvent / GapMarker
        v
bar_aggregator
        | BarEvent
        v
data_manager
        | QueryResult / DataEvent / PriceSnapshot
        v
API / WebSocket / Indicator / Subscription / Settings
```

Historical repair flow:

```text
QueryEngine / Settings / Ingestion GapMarker
        |
        v
BackfillCoordinator
        | priority / chunk scheduler
        v
BackfillEngine
        |
        v
storage readback
        |
        v
DataManager cache + EventBus
```

The formal backend path is centered on `DataManager` and `DataEngineRuntime`. Older `data_engine/collectors` and `data_engine/services` directories may still exist in the tree, but they are not the primary architecture documented for new work.

## Backend

The backend is a FastAPI app in [backend/app/main.py](backend/app/main.py). Startup does the following:

1. Initializes SQLite K-line storage.
2. Refreshes exchange metadata on a best-effort basis.
3. Starts `DataEngineRuntime`.
4. Attaches `app.state.data_engine_runtime` and `app.state.data_manager`.
5. Bridges `IndicatorEngine` to DataManager events.

Main backend documentation:

- [Backend README](backend/README.md)
- [Data Engine](backend/app/data_engine/README.md)
- [Data Engine 中文](backend/app/data_engine/README_zh.md)
- [Exchange plugin template](backend/app/exchanges/plugins/_template/README.md)

Core backend modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `app/api/v1` | HTTP and WebSocket API routers |
| `app/core` | Runtime config, paths, proxy persistence, market helpers |
| `app/exchanges` | Exchange registry, adapters, plugins, symbol normalization |
| `app/data_engine/runtime.py` | Data Engine composition root |
| `app/data_engine/ingestion` | Realtime exchange intake and normalization |
| `app/data_engine/bar_aggregator` | K-line bucket/merge/finalization/event lifecycle |
| `app/data_engine/data_manager` | Public data facade for query/cache/events/streams/backfill/prices/maintenance |
| `app/data_engine/backfill` | Historical detect/plan/fetch/reconcile/report pipeline behind the scheduler |
| `app/data_engine/storage` | SQLite K-line repository and gap ledger |
| `app/indicator` | Built-in indicators, Pyne runtime, indicator streaming |

## Frontend

The frontend is a React + Vite app using Lightweight Charts v5.

Frontend architecture notes:

- [Frontend Architecture](frontend/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Runtime Boundaries](frontend/src/runtime/README.md)

Important frontend pieces:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `frontend/src/App.jsx` | Composition root for runtime hooks and UI surfaces |
| `frontend/src/components/MultiPaneChart.jsx` | Multi-pane chart layout |
| `frontend/src/components/ChartWidget.jsx` | Lightweight Charts wrapper |
| `frontend/src/components/DrawingToolbar.jsx` | Drawing tool controls |
| `frontend/src/components/IndicatorPanel.jsx` | Lazy-loaded indicator browsing/configuration |
| `frontend/src/components/IndicatorEditor.jsx` | Pyne/custom indicator editor, loaded through indicator workflows |
| `frontend/src/components/SymbolSearch*.jsx` | Exchange-aware symbol search |
| `frontend/src/components/WatchlistSidebar.jsx` | Watchlists and price tracking |
| `frontend/src/components/SettingsModal.jsx` | Lazy-loaded proxy, data, chart, and maintenance settings |
| `frontend/src/runtime` | Runtime orchestration grouped by chart, streams, exchange, preferences, and workflows |
| `frontend/src/services/apiConfig.js` | API base and HTTP-to-WebSocket URL configuration |
| `frontend/src/services/api.js` | Main backend API client |
| `frontend/src/services/indicatorApi.js` | Indicator API client |
| `frontend/src/hooks/useIndicators.js` | Indicator HTTP/WS integration |
| `frontend/src/hooks/useDrawing.js` | Drawing state |

Frontend commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint
npm run smoke -- --url http://127.0.0.1:15173/
npm run smoke:chart-types
npm run smoke:export
npm run smoke:release
```

`smoke:chart-types` switches through and reload-restores all 15 main chart
types. `smoke:export` validates PNG/JPEG/WebP, all three capture scopes,
drawing visibility, watermarking, and real downloaded files. `smoke:release`
runs both matrices with drawing and indicator coverage.

## Indicators And Pyne

The indicator system has two execution paths:

- Built-in incremental indicators managed by `IndicatorEngine`.
- Pyne scripts executed through the backend script runtime.

Built-ins:

| Indicator | Output | Pane |
|---|---|---|
| `MA` | `ma` | main |
| `EMA` | `ema` | main |
| `MACD` | `dif`, `dea`, `hist` | separate |
| `RSI` | `rsi` | separate |
| `BOLL` | `middle`, `upper`, `lower` | main |
| `ATR` | `atr` | separate |
| `VOL` | `volume` | volume |

Pyne exposes Pine-style APIs such as:

```python
length = input.int(20, "Period", minval=1)
upper, mid, lower = ta.bb(close, length, 2.0)

p1 = plot(upper, "Upper", color=color.red)
plot(mid, "Middle", color=color.orange)
p2 = plot(lower, "Lower", color=color.green)
fill(p1, p2, color="rgba(59,130,246,0.08)")
```

Pyne supports `safe`, `research`, and `unsafe` security modes. Process execution is the default so the backend can enforce timeouts more reliably than inline execution.

Documentation:

- [Indicator Engine](backend/app/indicator/README.md)
- [Pyne Runtime](backend/app/indicator/pyne/README.md)

## API Documentation

The API reference is maintained separately:

- [API Reference](API.md)

## Development Checks

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
python -m compileall app tests -q
python -m pytest -q
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run lint
```

For rendered frontend smoke checks, start the backend and Vite, then run
`npm run smoke -- --url http://127.0.0.1:15173/`. The smoke check confirms the
status bar reaches `Connected to Binance`, shows non-zero `bars`, reports
`Live (WebSocket)`, loads the drawing toolbar, and opens the lazy-loaded symbol
search and Settings panels.
Changes to main chart types or export behavior should also run
`npm run smoke:release`. Use `npm run perf:soak:1h` and
`npm run perf:soak:4h` for long-running stability captures; reports are written
under `docs/perf-baselines/`.

## Notes

- Configure proxy settings in the app settings panel or through `/api/v1/settings/proxy` if your exchange access requires a proxy.
- Runtime proxy settings are persisted under `backend/data/proxy_settings.json` by default.
- On Windows, if backend startup fails while printing status symbols, start it with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` and `PYTHONUTF8=1`.
- SQLite data is local and ignored by git.
- Pyne scripts execute locally in the backend process/process pool according to the configured security mode. Only use `unsafe` for scripts you trust.
