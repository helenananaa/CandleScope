# CandleScope Backend

[中文](README_zh.md)

> FastAPI backend for CandleScope. It provides K-line data, realtime WebSocket streams, exchange metadata, indicator computation, custom Pyne scripts, proxy/settings management, subscriptions, and storage repair tools.

## Runtime Stack

- Python FastAPI app: `app/main.py`
- Core async infrastructure: `app/core/executors.py`, `app/core/runtime_metrics.py`
- Market data runtime: `app/data_engine/runtime.py`
- Exchange registry/plugins: `app/exchanges`
- Indicator engine and Pyne runtime: `app/indicator`
- Generic script-runtime Host/Supervisor/Installer: `app/plugin_runtime`
- SQLite K-line storage: `app/data_engine/storage`

## Quick Start

The web backend starts on CPython 3.11+. First-party Pyne/Pine bundles remain
Windows CPython 3.12 only; other hosts degrade that capability and still serve
K-lines and built-in indicators.

Linux / macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./dev-server.sh
```

```bash
./dev-server.sh --watch
```

Windows, with UTF-8 output:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\dev-server.ps1
```

```powershell
.\dev-server.ps1 -Watch
```

The Windows entrypoint leaves Uvicorn reload disabled because its Selector
event loop cannot launch sidecar subprocesses. Both helper scripts watch Python
files below `app`, then gracefully restart the single-process server (including
sidecar shutdown) after each change.

Default API base:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

Interactive docs:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:18080/docs
```

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/debug/snapshot
```

## Startup Sequence

`app/main.py` performs:

1. Start the event-loop lag monitor.
2. Initialize SQLite K-line storage.
3. Start the script-runtime plugin plane as a capability. Missing first-party
   sidecars degrade Pyne/Pine and do not abort DataEngine.
4. Refresh exchange symbol metadata on a best-effort basis.
5. Start Data Engine through `start_data_engine()`.
6. Attach stable runtime handles to `app.state`.
7. Bridge IndicatorEngine to DataManager events.

Shutdown stops the lag monitor and IndicatorEngine, reclaims plugin sidecars,
and then shuts down the Data Engine runtime. See
[`app/plugin_runtime/README.md`](app/plugin_runtime/README.md) and the
[`installer guide`](app/plugin_runtime/INSTALLER.md) for host configuration,
`.cspkg` installation, rollback, and security boundaries. Phase 3 does not
route the existing Indicator/Pyne path to sidecars.

## API Overview

All application APIs are mounted under `/api/v1`.

| Area | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| K-lines | `GET /klines/`, `/latest`, `/history`, `/range`, `/history/before`, `/resolve`, `/storage/meta`, `/continuity`, `DELETE /klines/storage` |
| Advanced market data | `GET /market/snapshot`, `GET /market/history` |
| Streams | `WS /stream/klines`, `WS /stream/klines_multi`, `WS /stream/indicators`, `WS /stream/prices`, `WS /stream/market` |
| Indicators | `GET /indicators/registry`, runtime discovery, presets, custom CRUD, Pyne security, diagnostics, `POST /indicators/compute` |
| Exchanges | `GET /exchanges/`, `GET /exchanges/diagnostics`, `GET /exchanges/{exchange}/capabilities` |
| Symbols | `GET /symbols/exchange-info`, `POST /symbols/exchange-info/refresh` |
| Settings | proxy get/update/test, storage repair, gap scan, storage health, cache limits |
| Subscriptions | list, sync, prices snapshot, get/set/delete symbol tier |
| Replay | v2 TrainingRun catalog/create/list/command/review/fork/report routes, plus the internal adapter get/command/journal/report and `WS /stream/replay/{session_id}` |

The enhanced K-line volume, delta, and CVD-contribution contract is documented in [`docs/KLINE_ORDER_FLOW_CONTRACT_zh.md`](../docs/KLINE_ORDER_FLOW_CONTRACT_zh.md).

System endpoints outside `/api/v1`:

- `GET /`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /debug/snapshot`

## Deterministic Replay Runtime

Replay is enabled in the normal build. An explicit `REPLAY_ENABLED=0` emergency
stop does not construct the `ReplayService`, open `REPLAY_DB_PATH`, start an
actor task, or allow session creation. The disabled capability response remains
stable so the independent frontend page shows `REPLAY_DISABLED` instead of
falling back to live data.

`REPLAY_ENABLED` is the sole whole-product operational stop. The TrainingRun
service is otherwise always constructed; there is no product selector, v1
fallback, gray rollout, or frontend entry flag. Archive validity remains
fail-closed per requested operation. Workers and optimization remain optional.

When enabled, replay owns a separate SQLite database and a bounded runtime:

```text
frozen BAR snapshot or exact paged AGG_TRADE archive
  -> single-writer ReplaySessionActor + virtual clock
  -> replay-only bar builder + PAPER_LINEAR_V1 broker/ledger
  -> commit-before-publish ReplaySQLiteStore
  -> replay.v1 HTTP + resumable bounded WebSocket
```

BAR replay defaults to an independent immutable Parquet history plane and does
not open the production K-line database. Commands, checkpoints, orders, fills,
ledger entries, journals, bounded selected snapshots, and reports are stored in
`REPLAY_DB_PATH`. Snapshot bodies are compressed, content-addressed files under
`<REPLAY_DB_PATH>.datasets`; SQLite keeps their checksums and references.
Active dataset snapshots/partitions, mailboxes, event rings, subscriber queues,
checkpoint history, and frontend projection windows all have explicit capacity
limits.

Treat `REPLAY_DB_PATH` and `<REPLAY_DB_PATH>.datasets` as one recovery set.
Stop the replay backend before copying or restoring them so SQLite references
and content-addressed snapshot objects remain from the same point in time.

Training drafts use `ALL_AVAILABLE` chart history by default. The immutable
execution snapshot remains bounded by indicator warmup plus forward cache;
older pre-start chart bars are paged from the same immutable replay-history
catalog revision that created the Run, up to its continuous-history boundary.
This path never queries live SQLite, never triggers exchange backfill, and
cannot reveal data after the durable virtual-time cursor.

### Replay Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `REPLAY_ENABLED` | `1` | Normal-build replay runtime; `0` is an explicit operational stop |
| `REPLAY_DB_PATH` | `<CANDLE_DATA_DIR>/replay.db` | Replay-only SQLite state; must differ from `KLINES_DB_PATH` |
| `REPLAY_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_DIR` | `<CANDLE_DATA_DIR>/replay-history` | Local archive, or disposable metadata/object cache when `REPLAY_HISTORY_ORIGIN_URI` is set |
| `REPLAY_HISTORY_ORIGIN_URI` | unset | Authoritative `file`/HTTP(S) history root; new catalogs/Runs fail closed when its current index is unavailable, while pinned Runs may read cached immutable revisions |
| `REPLAY_HISTORY_CATALOG_REFRESH_SECONDS` | `300` | Remote metadata refresh TTL; `0` refreshes on every catalog access |
| `REPLAY_HISTORY_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `60` | Bounded timeout for remote metadata and selected-object downloads |
| `REPLAY_AGG_TRADE_ENABLED` | `0` | Independent exact aggregate-trade replay gate |
| `REPLAY_AGG_TRADE_ARCHIVE_DIR` | `<CANDLE_DATA_DIR>/replay-agg-trades` | Read-only checksum-verified aggregate-trade replay archive |
| `REPLAY_AGG_TRADE_ORIGIN_URI` | unset | Authoritative remote compatibility/receipt index and on-demand aggregate-trade object origin |
| `REPLAY_MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` | `8` | Active pinned session limit |
| `REPLAY_COMMAND_QUEUE_SIZE` | `256` | Per-actor bounded command mailbox |
| `REPLAY_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE` | `10000` | Resumable domain event ring |
| `REPLAY_MAX_EMIT_FPS` | `30` | Ordinary projection ceiling; mandatory events flush immediately |
| `REPLAY_MAX_WARMUP_BARS` | `5000` | Session warmup ceiling |
| `REPLAY_MAX_BAR_DATASET_ROWS` | `100000` | Frozen BAR snapshot row ceiling |
| `REPLAY_MAX_HORIZON_DAYS` | `30` | BAR horizon ceiling |
| `REPLAY_TRADE_PAGE_ROWS` | `50000` | Maximum aggregate-trade page size |

| `REPLAY_CONTROLLER_TTL_SECONDS` | `10` | Controller heartbeat lease |
| `REPLAY_IDLE_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Configured idle-session lifetime |
| `RAW_AGG_TRADE_ARCHIVE_ENABLED` | `0` | Enables live aggregate-trade capture only |
| `RAW_AGG_TRADE_ARCHIVE_DIR` | `<CANDLE_DATA_DIR>/raw-agg-live-spool` | Mutable live capture spool; replay never reads this path |
| `REPLAY_HISTORICAL_BOOK_ENABLED` | `1` | Validate and use pinned historical L2 when the requested Run requires it; missing or invalid data fails that operation closed |
| `REPLAY_ACCOUNT_HISTORY_ENABLED` | `1` | Validate and use pinned account-history inputs when requested; missing or invalid data fails that operation closed |

Use [`.env.replay.example`](.env.replay.example) as a starting point. The
frontend entry is always present and backend capability remains authoritative.

### Data Preparation and Capability Rules

Install the Parquet dependency and build the BAR history catalog from official
checksum-verified Binance archives. Missing source objects split continuity;
they do not invalidate later continuous segments:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-parquet.txt

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\import_binance_replay_history.py `
  --market-type spot --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1m `
  --start 2017-07-01 --end 2026-07-30 `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-history

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\audit_replay_history.py `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-history `
  --market-type spot --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1m `
  --verify-objects

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\audit_replay_history_parity.py `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-history `
  --live-db .\data\candlescope.db `
  --market-type spot --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1m
```

The importer publishes content-addressed objects before atomically moving
`current.json`. Runs pin the selected catalog epoch, so a later import cannot
change their snapshot or `ALL_AVAILABLE` history. The retired SQLite reader is
not a runtime fallback: if the archive control plane or required immutable
objects are unavailable, creation of new Runs fails closed. The full BAR
archive contract and operations runbook is
[`../docs/KLINE_REPLAY_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_zh.md`](../docs/KLINE_REPLAY_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_zh.md).
When a closed monthly checksum is absent, the importer automatically attempts
that month's checksum-verified daily objects before declaring a source gap.

After publishing new current manifests to a remote origin, rebuild its compact
control-plane index. A runtime configured with an origin samples this index,
persists the exact selection, and only then downloads overlapping bodies into
its local cache:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\publish_replay_history_remote_index.py `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-history-origin
```

AGG_TRADE accepts only checksum-verified official Binance USD-M daily files.
Import is idempotent; identity, date, schema, checksum, monotonicity, or ID
conflicts are quarantined and keep the capability closed:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\import_binance_public_agg_trades.py `
  --exchange binance --market-type futures --symbol BTCUSDT `
  --start 2026-06-01 --end 2026-06-01 `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-agg-trades --require-checksum

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\audit_replay_trade_archive.py `
  --exchange binance --market-type futures --symbol BTCUSDT `
  --start 2026-06-01 --end 2026-06-01 `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-agg-trades --require-exact

# Optional offline audit only; runtime selection and Run creation do not require it.
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\build_replay_trade_bar_compatibility.py `
  --exchange binance --market-type futures --symbol BTCUSDT --interval 1m `
  --start 2026-06-01 --end 2026-06-01 `
  --trade-archive-dir .\data\replay-agg-trades `
  --bar-archive-dir .\data\replay-history
```

Random AGG_TRADE starts are sampled from the intersection of eligible BAR
windows and Binance's lightweight official daily-object availability catalog.
The catalog is built from complete ZIP/CHECKSUM pairs and is independent of the
local body cache. After selection, the required official daily ZIPs are fetched,
checksum-verified, imported, and checked for strict aggregate-trade ID ordering.
BAR parity is deliberately not a random eligibility condition because Binance
may aggregate fills across minute boundaries. The selected tape therefore drives
an explicitly approximate K-line projection.

For remote AGG_TRADE serving, sync the lightweight official listing and publish
the bound index. Legacy verified receipts and BAR compatibility proofs may remain
in the origin, but neither local nor pre-imported body coverage defines random
eligibility:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\publish_replay_agg_trade_remote_index.py `
  --archive-dir .\data\replay-agg-trades-origin `
  --sync-binance-symbol BTCUSDT
```

`EXACT_BAR_COVERAGE` uses the conservative BAR execution model.
`VERIFIED_AGG_TRADE_APPROXIMATE_BARS` uses a checksum-bound, ID-contiguous
aggregate-tape and a volume-constrained execution model. Its tape integrity is
strict, while its derived OHLCV and indicators are approximate. Replay v1 does
**not** provide or claim `RAW_TRADE`, `L2_BOOK`, official-Kline parity, or
`EXCHANGE_FUTURES_EXACT` fidelity.

For AGG_TRADE sessions, session creation downloads only the selected official
daily objects, verifies the official CHECKSUM plus generated object manifests,
freezes an immutable dataset, and scans the selected range for strict ordering
and aggregate-ID continuity.
It does not compare derived bars with official K-lines. The K-line `trades`
counter and aggregate events spanning a minute boundary are explicitly outside
the fidelity claim.

### Failure Recovery and Rollback

- Graceful shutdown first pauses a `PLAYING` actor, persists
  `status_reason=shutdown_pause`, flushes/checkpoints, then closes the store.
- Restart recovery is `PAUSED` or `ENDED`; wall-clock autoplay and controller
  ownership are never restored.
- Controller expiry, sequence/epoch mismatch, slow subscribers, SQLite busy or
  write failure, corrupt checkpoints, dataset drift, and degraded archives all
  fail closed with bounded diagnostics or explicit resynchronization.
- For an emergency operational stop, set `REPLAY_ENABLED=0` and restart the
  backend, or deploy the previous verified build. The visible entry reports
  persistence unopened; retain `replay.db`.
- To roll back only aggregate-trade replay, set
  `REPLAY_AGG_TRADE_ENABLED=0`; live capture and BAR replay are independent.
- BAR replay has no legacy SQLite fallback. Keep
  `REPLAY_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_DIR` and its published epochs intact because active
  Runs pin those immutable catalog revisions.
- Replay storage schema upgrades are forward-only. Before starting a build that
  migrates `replay.db`, stop replay and back up both `replay.db` and its
  `.datasets` directory. A full rollback to an older replay-aware build must
  either keep `REPLAY_ENABLED=0` or restore that pre-upgrade recovery set; it
  must not open a newer schema with the older runtime.

Formal local gates are `scripts/audit_replay_determinism.py`,
`scripts/benchmark_replay.py`, the frontend `smoke:replay` and 4-hour replay
soak, and `frontend/scripts/replay-rollback-drill.ps1`. Normal builds are
default-on; release evidence must prove the hard-cut contract and whole-build
rollback without relying on a gray flag.

```

Detailed docs:

- [app/data_engine](app/data_engine/)
- [app/data_engine/ingestion](app/data_engine/ingestion/)
- [app/data_engine/bar_aggregator](app/data_engine/bar_aggregator/)
- [app/data_engine/backfill](app/data_engine/backfill/)

- [app/data_engine/ARCHITECTURE_POLISH_ROADMAP.md](app/data_engine/ARCHITECTURE_POLISH_ROADMAP.md)

## Concurrency Model

The backend keeps the FastAPI event loop as an orchestration layer. Blocking or heavy work is routed through bounded infrastructure instead of running inline on the loop.

```text
FastAPI event loop
  -> request / WebSocket orchestration
  -> no blocking storage query
  -> no heavy indicator compute
  -> no Pyne process wait

Core executors
  -> indicator executor: builtin indicator HTTP/range compute
  -> pyne-wait executor: Pyne process wait and Pyne snapshot work
  -> storage executor: SQLite/DataManager synchronous storage paths

DataEventBus
  -> emit() filters and enqueues
  -> each callback subscriber has a bounded queue and worker
  -> iterator subscribers use bounded queues

BackfillScheduler
  -> priority queue
  -> per-series single flight
  -> global concurrency limit
  -> token bucket rate limit
  -> delayed drain wakeup after rate-limit skips
```

New core modules:

- `app/core/executors.py` owns the dedicated thread pools and executor queue/run statistics.
- `app/core/runtime_metrics.py` owns event-loop lag sampling and aggregate WebSocket send/heartbeat metrics.

This keeps business ownership local: APIs orchestrate, DataEventBus delivers events, BackfillScheduler schedules repairs, and core modules provide shared runtime infrastructure.

## Exchange Plugins

Built-in exchanges are registered through `app.exchanges.registry`:

- Binance
- OKX

Plugin template:

- [app/exchanges/plugins/_template](app/exchanges/plugins/_template/)

Architecture guide:

- [app/exchanges](app/exchanges/)

Exchange plugins expose capabilities, symbol normalization, REST/WS protocol specs, subscription specs, realtime policy, rate limits, pagination policy, and payload normalization. Adapters remain as legacy facades for older imports.

Long-lived plugin boundaries:

- Capability schema v2 adds an authoritative per-market `channels` matrix: realtime/history transports, delivery class, snapshot/delta and resync semantics, normalized field availability, parameters, update intervals, limits, connection model, and known limitations. Schema-v1 plugins remain loadable; their empty channel matrix means "unknown", not "unsupported".
- `ExchangeRegistry.register()` rejects plugins whose major plugin API version or capability schema is not supported by this backend.
- `GET /api/v1/exchanges/diagnostics` reports load status, protocol class, adapter facade, policy classes, and capability coverage counts for each plugin.
- `app.exchanges.contracts` provides a reusable contract harness for capability declarations, REST specs, WS connection models, payload extraction, historical pagination, fixture coverage, and normalizer output schema.
- Built-in contract fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/exchanges/`; add new exchange fixtures there before wiring the plugin into runtime code.
- Optional out-of-tree plugins can be loaded with `CANDLESCOPE_EXCHANGE_PLUGINS=module.path,module.path:factory`. This path is explicit and diagnostics-backed; built-in plugins still load first.
- The frontend consumes `/api/v1/exchanges/` for interval lists, market availability, WS mode, and user-visible limitations. Keep new exchange UI behavior in capabilities rather than hard-coded frontend branches.

## Indicators And Pyne

Indicator docs:

- [app/indicator](app/indicator/)
- [Runtime plugin host](app/plugin_runtime/README.md)
- [Pyne sidecar bridge](../packages/candlescope-plugin-pyne/README.md)
- [Pyne workbench v2](../packages/candlescope-plugin-pyne-workbench/README.md)

Built-ins include `MA`, `EMA`, `MACD`, `RSI`, `BOLL`, `ATR`, and `VOL`.

Pyne scripts run only through the isolated `candlescope.pyne` sidecar. Security
modes are `safe`, `research`, and `unsafe`; the sidecar inherits the selected
policy without importing Pyne into the backend process.

CandleScope contains neither a Pyne Runtime source snapshot nor an in-process
Pyne facade. On the first supported Windows CPython 3.12 startup, the product
bootstrap verifies and installs the exact prerelease `.cspkg` pinned in
`app/official-plugin-releases.json`. Later startups rerun the managed
environment probe without downloading again:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

Diagnostics expose the selected sidecar route under
`/api/v1/indicators/diagnostics -> pyne.runtimeBackend`.

For an offline first run, provide the same digest-pinned bundle explicitly:

```powershell
$env:CANDLESCOPE_OFFICIAL_PLUGIN_BUNDLE = "C:\release\candlescope-pyne-0.2.0-cp312-win_amd64.cspkg"
```

Set `CANDLESCOPE_OFFICIAL_PLUGIN_BOOTSTRAP=0` only when a compatible runtime is
already activated manually. Community runtimes continue to use the generic
local-artifact installer and are never downloaded or overwritten by the
first-party bootstrap.

HTTP indicator compute is offloaded through dedicated executors:

- Builtin indicator HTTP compute uses one-shot engine instances so it does not mutate the app-wide realtime `IndicatorEngine`.
- Script HTTP, range, batch, and WebSocket paths send typed requests to the selected sidecar.
- Both paths are guarded by `INDICATOR_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

## Observability And Benchmarks

Diagnostics are exposed through existing endpoints:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/debug/snapshot
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/indicators/diagnostics
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/settings/storage/health
```

Important fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_loop_lag` | event-loop scheduling lag summary from `/health` |
| `runtime.event_loop_lag` | full event-loop lag snapshot in `/debug/snapshot` |
| `runtime.websocket.heartbeat_delay` | WebSocket heartbeat scheduling delay |
| `runtime.websocket.send_timeouts` | timed-out WebSocket sends grouped by payload type |
| `executors.*` | per-executor submitted/active/pending and queue/run timing |
| `event_bus.callback_lag` | callback subscriber queue lag and drops |
| `event_bus.queue_lag` | async-iterator subscriber queue lag and drops |
| `ready_chunks` / `running_chunks` / `next_drain_in_ms` | backfill scheduler state |

Run the concurrency benchmark against a live backend:

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/bench_concurrency.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

The benchmark exercises K-line latest queries, builtin indicator compute, Pyne compute, visible range repair, and the main WebSocket streams, then prints latency percentiles plus diagnostics before/after the run.

## Configuration

Environment variables are loaded through `python-dotenv`.

Common variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CANDLE_HOST` | backend host, default `0.0.0.0` |
| `CANDLE_PORT` | backend port, default `8000` |
| `CANDLE_DATA_DIR` | data directory, default `backend/data` |
| `KLINES_DB_PATH` | SQLite DB path |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | comma-separated frontend origins |
| `INGESTION_*` | realtime ingestion endpoints, timeout, proxy, WS/fallback tuning |
| `BACKFILL_*` | historical repair intervals, fetch limits, dedup, publish mode |
| `HISTORY_ARCHIVE_ENABLED` | official historical ZIP routing, default `1` |
| `HISTORY_ARCHIVE_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` | persistent archive LRU cap, default 10 GiB |
| `OKX_HISTORY_ARCHIVE_ENABLED` | guarded OKX website archive support, default `0` |
| `BAR_AGG_*` | aggregation source mode, alignment, finalization, event throttling |
| `PYNE_*` | Pyne security, executor mode, timeouts, output limits |
| `INDICATOR_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | HTTP indicator compute wait cap |
| `INDICATOR_THREAD_WORKERS` | builtin indicator executor size |
| `PYNE_HTTP_THREAD_WORKERS` | Pyne wait executor size |
| `STORAGE_THREAD_WORKERS` | storage executor size |
| `WS_SEND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | WebSocket send timeout |
| `EVENT_LOOP_LAG_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | event-loop lag sampling interval |

Proxy settings can also be updated through API and are persisted to:

```text
DATA_DIR/proxy_settings.json
```

## Storage

K-line storage is SQLite-backed. Internal timestamps use milliseconds. API chart bars use seconds in `BarData.time` for `lightweight-charts`.

Maintenance endpoints can:

- rebuild custom intervals from base intervals,
- scan and repair gaps,
- show gap ledger health,
- update retention limits.

## Tests

Run all backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest -q
```

Dependency boundaries (without importing or starting the application):

```bash
cd backend
python -B scripts/check_architecture.py
python -B -m pytest -q tests/test_api_dependency_boundaries.py tests/test_replay_dependency_boundaries.py
```

Business packages cannot import `app.api` or `app.main`; the HTTP tree and
`app.main` own route composition. Shared request models, symbol catalogs and
order-book contracts/projections belong to their business modules. HTTP adapters
map domain errors to wire responses. The gate checks absolute, relative and
literal dynamic imports, plus transitive dependencies of shared modules. A fresh
process test blocks FastAPI/Starlette while exercising preparation, history and
plugin reads.

The same gate enforces replay responsibility direction and keeps SQLite
transaction ownership out of extracted persistence operations. See the
[training ownership guide](app/replay/training/README.md) for transaction,
publication and recovery boundaries.
