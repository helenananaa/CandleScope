# CandleScope Backend

[中文](README_zh.md)

> FastAPI backend for CandleScope. It provides K-line data, realtime WebSocket streams, exchange metadata, indicator computation, custom Pyne scripts, proxy/settings management, subscriptions, and storage repair tools.

## Runtime Stack

- Python FastAPI app: `app/main.py`
- Core async infrastructure: `app/core/executors.py`, `app/core/runtime_metrics.py`
- Market data runtime: `app/data_engine/runtime.py`
- Exchange registry/plugins: `app/exchanges`
- Indicator engine and Pyne runtime: `app/indicator`
- SQLite K-line storage: `app/data_engine/storage`

## Quick Start

```powershell
.\dev-server.ps1
```

On Linux/WSL:

```bash
sh ./dev-server.sh
```

These launchers run the idempotent `setup.ps1` / `setup.sh` first. Setup creates
`backend/.venv`, installs requirements only when their hash changes, then
prepares the registry's auto-install managed plugins with pinned manifests,
SHA-256 checks, and host probes. It starts the server with that exact Python.
Use `-Offline` / `--offline` after one successful setup has prepared
dependencies and cached Releases. Use `-SkipManagedPlugins` /
`--skip-managed-plugins` to skip all managed plugins; the retained
`-SkipPineRuntime` / `--skip-pine-runtime` option excludes only Pine.

Default API base:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

Interactive docs:

```text

```

Health checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/debug/snapshot
```

## Startup Sequence

`app/main.py` performs:

1. Start the event-loop lag monitor.
2. Initialize SQLite K-line storage.
3. Refresh exchange symbol metadata on a best-effort basis.
4. Start Data Engine through `start_data_engine()`.
5. Attach stable runtime handles to `app.state`.
6. Bridge IndicatorEngine to DataManager events.

Shutdown stops the lag monitor, stops IndicatorEngine, and then shuts down the Data Engine runtime.

## API Overview

All application APIs are mounted under `/api/v1`.

| Area | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| K-lines | `GET /klines/`, `/latest`, `/history`, `/range`, `/history/before`, `/resolve`, `/storage/meta`, `/continuity`, `DELETE /klines/storage` |
| Advanced market data | `GET /market/snapshot`, `GET /market/history` |
| Streams | `WS /stream/klines`, `WS /stream/klines_multi`, `WS /stream/indicators`, `WS /stream/prices`, `WS /stream/market` |
| Indicators | `GET /indicators/registry`, presets, custom CRUD, Pyne security, diagnostics, `POST /indicators/compute` |
| Exchanges | `GET /exchanges/`, `GET /exchanges/diagnostics`, `GET /exchanges/{exchange}/capabilities` |
| Symbols | `GET /symbols/exchange-info`, `POST /symbols/exchange-info/refresh` |
| Settings | proxy get/update/test, storage repair, gap scan, storage health, cache limits |
| Subscriptions | list, sync, prices snapshot, get/set/delete symbol tier |

The enhanced K-line volume, delta, and CVD-contribution contract is documented in [`docs/KLINE_ORDER_FLOW_CONTRACT_zh.md`](../docs/KLINE_ORDER_FLOW_CONTRACT_zh.md).

System endpoints outside `/api/v1`:

- `GET /`
- `GET /health`
- `GET /debug/snapshot`

## Concurrency Model

The backend keeps the FastAPI event loop as an orchestration layer. Blocking or heavy work is routed through bounded infrastructure instead of running inline on the loop.

```text
FastAPI event loop
  -> request / WebSocket orchestration
  -> no blocking storage query
  -> no heavy indicator compute
  -> no Pyne process wait

Core executors
  -> indicator executor: builtin indicator HTTP/range compute
  -> pyne-wait executor: Pyne process wait and Pyne snapshot work
  -> storage executor: SQLite/DataManager synchronous storage paths

DataEventBus
  -> emit() filters and enqueues
  -> each callback subscriber has a bounded queue and worker
  -> iterator subscribers use bounded queues

BackfillScheduler
  -> priority queue
  -> per-series single flight
  -> global concurrency limit
  -> token bucket rate limit
  -> delayed drain wakeup after rate-limit skips
```

New core modules:

- `app/core/executors.py` owns the dedicated thread pools and executor queue/run statistics.
- `app/core/runtime_metrics.py` owns event-loop lag sampling and aggregate WebSocket send/heartbeat metrics.

This keeps business ownership local: APIs orchestrate, DataEventBus delivers events, BackfillScheduler schedules repairs, and core modules provide shared runtime infrastructure.

## Exchange Plugins

Built-in exchanges are registered through `app.exchanges.registry`:

- Binance
- OKX

Plugin template:

- [app/exchanges/plugins/_template](app/exchanges/plugins/_template/)

Architecture guide:

- [app/exchanges](app/exchanges/)

Exchange plugins expose capabilities, symbol normalization, REST/WS protocol specs, subscription specs, realtime policy, rate limits, pagination policy, and payload normalization. Adapters remain as legacy facades for older imports.

Long-lived plugin boundaries:

- Capability schema v2 adds an authoritative per-market `channels` matrix: realtime/history transports, delivery class, snapshot/delta and resync semantics, normalized field availability, parameters, update intervals, limits, connection model, and known limitations. Schema-v1 plugins remain loadable; their empty channel matrix means "unknown", not "unsupported".
- `ExchangeRegistry.register()` rejects plugins whose major plugin API version or capability schema is not supported by this backend.
- `GET /api/v1/exchanges/diagnostics` reports load status, protocol class, adapter facade, policy classes, and capability coverage counts for each plugin.
- `app.exchanges.contracts` provides a reusable contract harness for capability declarations, REST specs, WS connection models, payload extraction, historical pagination, fixture coverage, and normalizer output schema.
- Built-in contract fixtures live under `tests/fixtures/exchanges/`; add new exchange fixtures there before wiring the plugin into runtime code.
- Optional out-of-tree plugins can be loaded with `CANDLESCOPE_EXCHANGE_PLUGINS=module.path,module.path:factory`. This path is explicit and diagnostics-backed; built-in plugins still load first.
- The frontend consumes `/api/v1/exchanges/` for interval lists, market availability, WS mode, and user-visible limitations. Keep new exchange UI behavior in capabilities rather than hard-coded frontend branches.

## Indicators And Script Runtimes

Indicator docs:

- [app/indicator](app/indicator/)
- [app/indicator/pyne](app/indicator/pyne/)
- [packages/pine-compat-runtime](../packages/pine-compat-runtime/)

Built-ins include `MA`, `EMA`, `MACD`, `RSI`, `BOLL`, `ATR`, and `VOL`.

Pyne scripts run through `execute_pyne_script()` with process execution by default. Security modes are `safe`, `research`, and `unsafe`.

The backend imports Pyne through `app.indicator.pyne`, backed by the bundled
`packages/pyne-runtime` package in this repository. The backend loads that
source tree automatically, so a normal backend install is enough:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

Diagnostics expose the selected runtime package under
`/api/v1/indicators/diagnostics -> pyne.runtimeBackend`.

If you want to test a newer external Pyne checkout temporarily, override the
source path for that shell session:

```powershell
$env:CANDLESCOPE_PYNE_RUNTIME_SRC = "<path-to-pyne-runtime>\src"
```

Managed plugin setup is registry-driven. `CANDLESCOPE_PLUGINS.json` selects the
checked-in plugin locks that setup prepares; the shared installer owns HTTPS
download, manifest/artifact digest verification, platform selection, atomic
cache writes, installation stamps, and fresh-process probes. Pine is the first
consumer and remains an explicit sibling of Pyne. Its pinned source lives in
`packages/pine-compat-runtime`; normal users install the verified binary
Release rather than compiling Rust locally.

Inspect or check the managed set, or use the retained Pine-only compatibility
entrypoint:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\ensure_managed_plugins.py --list
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\ensure_managed_plugins.py --check
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\ensure_pine_runtime.py --check
```

Pine keeps its existing
`packages/pine-compat-runtime/CANDLESCOPE_RUNTIME.json` path and schema for
backward compatibility; the generic loader adapts it to the managed-plugin
contract and derives the locked wheel contract and Pine probe. It pins the
Release tag, commit, and manifest digest. The trusted manifest
pins every platform wheel's name, size, and digest. The current `python-wheel`
driver supports the published Windows x86-64 and manylinux x86-64 wheels,
writes only the selected backend environment and a per-user cache, and refuses
unsupported platforms or free-threaded CPython. It never installs transitive
dependencies or silently falls back to a source build.

Adding another verified wheel plugin requires a plugin lock plus one registry
entry; `python-import` supplies the generic version/import probe. A richer host
contract can add a named probe without duplicating the download/install path.
See [MANAGED_PLUGINS.md](MANAGED_PLUGINS.md) for the schema and extension path.

When the wheel is absent from a manually managed environment, only requests
with `runtime="pine-compat"` fail with `PINE_RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE`; Pyne remains
available. Runtime availability is exposed by `GET /api/v1/indicators/runtimes`
and diagnostics. Existing records and requests without a runtime continue to
default to `pyne`.

Pine v1 performs historical batch execution over closed bars only. The host
currently maps `plot`, `plotchar`, `plotshape`, `plotarrow`, `hline`, `fill`,
`bgcolor`, `barcolor`, and alerts. It explicitly rejects `request.*`, strategy,
imports, chart-context features, forming bars, and native drawing objects.

HTTP indicator compute is offloaded through dedicated executors:

- Builtin indicator HTTP compute uses one-shot engine instances so it does not mutate the app-wide realtime `IndicatorEngine`.
- Pyne and Pine HTTP/range paths use separate wait executors around their process-based runtimes.
- Both paths are guarded by `INDICATOR_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

## Observability And Benchmarks

Diagnostics are exposed through existing endpoints:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/debug/snapshot
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/indicators/diagnostics
curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/v1/settings/storage/health
```

Important fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `event_loop_lag` | event-loop scheduling lag summary from `/health` |
| `runtime.event_loop_lag` | full event-loop lag snapshot in `/debug/snapshot` |
| `runtime.websocket.heartbeat_delay` | WebSocket heartbeat scheduling delay |
| `runtime.websocket.send_timeouts` | timed-out WebSocket sends grouped by payload type |
| `executors.*` | per-executor submitted/active/pending and queue/run timing |
| `event_bus.callback_lag` | callback subscriber queue lag and drops |
| `event_bus.queue_lag` | async-iterator subscriber queue lag and drops |
| `ready_chunks` / `running_chunks` / `next_drain_in_ms` | backfill scheduler state |

Run the concurrency benchmark against a live backend:

```bash
cd backend
python scripts/bench_concurrency.py --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080
```

The benchmark exercises K-line latest queries, builtin indicator compute, Pyne compute, visible range repair, and the main WebSocket streams, then prints latency percentiles plus diagnostics before/after the run.

## Configuration

Proxy settings can also be updated through API and are persisted to:

```text
DATA_DIR/proxy_settings.json
```

## Storage

K-line storage is SQLite-backed. Internal timestamps use milliseconds. API chart bars use seconds in `BarData.time` for `lightweight-charts`.

Maintenance endpoints can:

- rebuild custom intervals from base intervals,
- scan and repair gaps,
- show gap ledger health,
- update retention limits.
