# CandleScope Market Scanner plugin

This package turns the SDK's audited read-only Market Scanner reference into an
installable first-party Plugin Platform v2 sidecar.

It can only read Host-brokered public symbol and bar data inside the scopes in
`manifest.json`. Results are written to plugin-private storage and optionally
published as bounded chart markers. It has no account, credential, arbitrary
filesystem, subprocess, or live-trading permission.

The manifest owns its English defaults and contribution localizations for
`zh-CN`, `es`, `fr`, `ja`, `ko`, `pt-BR`, `ru`, `zh-TW`, `de`, `it`, `id`,
`tr`, `vi`, and `pl`, including localized enum labels. Invocation locale is delivered through
`requestContext.locale`; validation failures produced by this package follow
that locale.
